Title: Convert 'R Markdown' and 'Quarto' Documents to Ecological
        Metadata Language
Version: 0.1.2
Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "Martin",
             family = "Westgate",
             email = "martin.westgate@csiro.au",
             role = c("aut", "cre")),
      person(given = "Shandiya",
             family = "Balasubramaniam",
             email = "shandiya.balasubramaniam@csiro.au",

Description: Ecological Metadata Language or 'EML' is a long-established format
  for describing ecological datasets to facilitate sharing and re-use. Because
  'EML' is effectively a modified 'xml' schema, however, it is challenging to 
  write and manipulate for non-expert users. 'delma' supports users to write 
  metadata statements in 'R Markdown' or 'Quarto markdown' format, and parse 
  them to 'EML' and (optionally) back again.
