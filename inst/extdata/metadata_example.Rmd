```{=html}
<!--
This is a metadata template. 

It is formatted to render as an html document (using the "Knit" button or
`knitr::knit()`) AND to Ecological Metadata language (EML) using the 
{delma} R package. Sections can 
be added, re-arranged or removed to suit the dataset being described. Some 
features to be aware of:

- Headings are converted to camelCase for use as EML tags
- Header level sets the degree of nestedness for those tags
- Code blocks whose `label` corresponds to a supplied EML tag are used to set 
  attributes for that tag using `list()`

See https:://delma.ala.org.au for software information or 
https://eml.ecoinformatics.org for information on EML.

### Introduction

This section can include any methods you like, but should, at minimum, give a simple description of how the data were collected. To link to a publication with more complete information, add a level-2 heading called `Reference Publication` and add the citation to your paper.

If applicable, you can also choose to add information on data processing that are specific to this version of your dataset. This may include information on whether data on threatened species have been removed, or spatial data have been generalised (i.e. set to a lower spatial precision than the source dataset).
